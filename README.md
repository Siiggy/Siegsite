# Siegsite

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. Feel free to browse, hover and click around.
The code for this project is also visible on GitHub.

The convention is to always design for mobile-first, but since most people will watch this portfolio site from a working environment on their desktop, I decided to make an exception for this project and do it the other way around, so the few included media querys are for mobile view.

_Starting the sass watcher:_ **sass --watch sass:css**

- Nieuwe transform met tekst transform opacity in de animation
- Uitleg op JS pagina's
